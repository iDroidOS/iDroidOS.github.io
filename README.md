# iDroidOS

Welcome to the iDroidOS project! We are currently undertaking the ambitious task of decompiling iOS and making it open source. Thank you for checking out our project.

## What is iDroidOS?

As stated previously, iDroidOS is an attempt to decompile iOS, recompile it with minimal bugs or errors, and ensure compatibility with essential apps. Our ultimate goal is to run it on real hardware, and perhaps even backport it to older devices like iOS 15 on an iPhone 6 for example.

## Project Goals

1. **Decompile iOS:**
   - Thoroughly analyze and deconstruct the iOS codebase.
   - Understand the underlying architecture and components.

2. **Recompile with Minimal Errors:**
   - Modify and refine the decompiled code to eliminate bugs.
   - Ensure the system is stable and functional.

3. **App Compatibility:**
   - Focus on making core apps, such as the Settings app, fully functional.
   - Gradually extend compatibility to more apps.

4. **Real Hardware Implementation:**
   - Address hardware compatibility issues and optimize performance issues.

5. **Backporting:**
   - Explore the possibility of backporting iDroidOS to older hardware.
   - Ensure older devices can benefit from the project.

## Why iDroidOS?

The iDroidOS project aims to provide an open-source alternative to iOS, giving users more control over their devices. By decompiling and recompiling iOS, we hope to foster innovation and customization in the mobile OS landscape.

## How You Can Contribute

We welcome contributions from developers, testers, and enthusiasts. Hereâ€™s how you can help:

1. **Development:**
   - Assist in decompiling and understanding iOS components.
   - Contribute to code refinement and bug fixing.

2. **Testing:**
   - Test iDroidOS on various hardware configurations.
   - Report bugs and provide feedback on system performance.

3. **Documentation:**
   - Help document the decompilation and recompilation process.
   - Create guides and tutorials for new contributors.

4. **Community Support:**
   - Engage with the community on forums and social media.
   - Share your experiences and help others troubleshoot issues.
